= An Easy Way to Understand Quaternion and Rotation
== Part 1. Theory

Quaternion is widely used in game engines to represent 3D rotation. As a game engineer you might be using quaternion explicitly or implicitly in your daily work, but do you really understand what is going on under the hood when you are calling “rotate a vector” or “combine two rotations”? Why rotating a vector stem:[v] by quaternion stem:[q] is calculated by a “sandwich” multiplication: stem:[qvq^{-1}] ? Why rotating by quaternion stem:[q_1] then stem:[q_2] is in the reversed order: stem:[{q_2}{q_1}], and can you visualize the result rotation axis and angle?
