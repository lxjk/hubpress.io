I came across this problem when fixing shadow shimmering in Cascaded Shadow Map, but it could be used in many other cases. To describe what we are going to do more specifically: given a frustum with near plane stem:[n], far plane stem:[f], and field of view angle stem:[fov], we need to calculate the center stem:[C] and radius stem:[R] of its minimal bounding sphere. In the calculation we will use right hand Y up coordinate system (forward is –Z axis) for 3D, and a similar coordinate system (forward is –Y axis) for 2D. For convenience we denote half FOV angle as stem:[α=\frac{fov}{2}].

Let’s start with 2D situation. First consider an extreme case as shown in figure 1 (a), if near plane is very closed to far plane, that is stem:[n=f]. Obviously our minimal bounding sphere sits in the center of far plane, and the radius will be half far plane width:

[stem]
++++
C = (0, -f)
R = f\tanα
++++

Consider another extreme case as shown in figure 1 (b), if near plane is stem:[0], that is stem:[n=0.] We are actually calculating the circumscribed circle of an isosceles triangle. The center of our bounding sphere sits on Y axis stem:[C=(0,-R)]. I’m not going to calculate the radius here, since we don’t need it for the following calculation, but it should be easy to figure out if you are interested.

Now let’s go back to the normal case as shown in figure 2. Intuitively we can guess the minimal bounding sphere should sits on somewhere between near plane center stem:[{N_0}(0,-n)] and far plane center stem:[{F_0}(0,-f)], and it should have the same distance to all 4 vertices of the frustum, that is stem:[\left|\vec{C{N_1}}\right|=\left|\vec{C{N_2}}\right|=\left|\vec{C{F_1}}\right|=\left|\vec{C{F_2}}\right|=R]. Can we actually find such a point? Since frustum is symmetrical along Y axis, if we found a point stem:[C] such that stem:[\left|\vec{C{N_1}}\right|=\left|\vec{C{F_1}}\right|=R], it is guaranteed we will have stem:[\left|\vec{C{N_2}}\right|=\left|\vec{C{F_2}}\right|=R] as well. Now we just need to calculate that point.
